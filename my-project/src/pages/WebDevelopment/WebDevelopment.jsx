                Before you start designing or developing your website, it’s
                important to define your objectives and goals. What do you want
                to achieve with your website? Who is your target audience? What
                type of content will you be publishing? By answering these
                questions, you’ll be able to create a clear vision for your
                website that guides the entire design and development process.

                Once you have a clear understanding of your objectives and
                goals, it’s time to do your research. This involves studying
                your target audience, analyzing your competition, and exploring
                the latest design and development trends. The information you
                gather during this stage will help you make informed decisions

                The next step in the process is the design and wireframing
                stage. During this stage, you’ll create a visual representation
                of your website, including its layout, colour scheme, and
                typography. This stage also involves creating wireframes, which
                are rough sketches of each page of your website. The wireframes
                help you visualize the structure and hierarchy of your website

            </div>

            <div className="text-gray-300 mt-6">
              A static website is a type of website that consists of a set of
              HTML pages that remain unchanged until they are manually updated.
              Unlike dynamic websites, which retrieve information from a
              database and display it in real-time, static websites are
              pre-built and display the same content to all users.
              <br />
              <br />
              One of the main benefits of a static website is its simplicity.
              Because they do not require a database or server-side scripting,
              they are easy to create, host, and maintain. This makes them ideal
              for small businesses, personal websites, and portfolios, where the
              focus is on showcasing content rather than providing interactive
              experiences.
              <br /> <br />
              Static websites also load faster than dynamic websites, as they do
              not require complex processes to retrieve information from a
              database. This can improve the user experience, especially on
              mobile devices with slow internet connections. Another advantage
              of static websites is their improved security. Because they do not
              use databases or server-side scripting, they are less vulnerable
              to hacking and other security threats.
              <br />
              <br />
              In conclusion, a static website is a great choice for businesses
              or individuals who want a simple, fast, and secure website that
              showcases content without the need for dynamic features. If you’re
              looking for a no-fuss solution for your online presence, a static
              website is a great place to start.
